# JavaScript-Practice
JavaScript practice repository for learning and experiementation. Includes exercises, challenges, and notes.

### Key Concepts Learned
- Variable declarations (`var`, `let`, `const`)
- Scope [and Hoisting]
- Destructuring assignment

## JavaScript Practice Snippets

### Variables
- Declarations: using `let`, `const`, and `var` to declare variables.
- Scope: understanding the difference between block-level and function-level scope
- Data Types: working with strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and objects.

### Loops
- Loop declarations (`for`, `while`, `do... while`)
- `continue` statement: skip current loop iteration, moving to next one.
- `break` statement: terminates loop, exiting when condition is met.

### Advanced JavaScript Concepts
- Destructuring (object & array destructuring): introduced but not fully explored; will revisit as more practice is done.
