# JavaScript-Practice
JavaScript practice repository for learning and experiementation. Includes exercises, challenges, and notes.

### Key Concepts Learned
- Variables
- Loops
- Operators

## JavaScript Practice Snippets

### Variables
- Declarations: using `let`, `const`, and `var` to declare variables.
- Scope: understanding the difference between block-level and function-level scope
- Data Types: working with strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and objects.

### Loops
- Loop declarations (`for`, `while`, `do... while`)
- `break` statement: terminates loop, exiting when condition is met.
- `continue` statement: skip current loop iteration, moving to next one.
- **Nested loops**: a loop inside another loop, commonly used for working with grids, tables, or patterns.  
- **Infinite loops**: loops that run indefinitely due to a missing exit condition; useful in some cases but usually an error.  

### Operators
- **Currently using:** Arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `**`), Assignment operators (`=`, `+=`, `-=`, etc.), Comparison operators (`==`, `===`, `!=`, `!==`, etc.), Logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`).
- **Future use:** Increment & decrement (`++`, `--`), Other advanced operators as needed.

### Advanced JavaScript Concepts
- Destructuring (object & array destructuring): introduced but not fully explored; will revisit as more practice is done.
